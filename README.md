# Aura.Ai

*Aura.Ai* is a web-based project that explores the world of Artificial Intelligence — from its origins to its modern applications and ethical challenges.  
The site is divided into clear, themed sections that guide users through the story of AI:

- *Introduction* – a brief overview of what AI is and why it matters  
- *History* – key milestones in the development of AI  
- *Core Applications* – how AI is used in areas like machine learning, robotics, and data analysis  
- *Industry Applications* – real-world examples in healthcare, finance, and other fields  
- *Ethics* – the moral and societal implications of artificial intelligence  
- *The Future* – where AI might be headed next

## 💡 Technical Overview

Aura.Ai was built entirely using *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript* without any external frameworks.  
The design emphasizes clarity and accessibility, combining minimal visuals with smooth interactivity.

A unique feature of the site is an *interactive particle system* created with JavaScript.  
Particles *flow and drift dynamically* across the screen, responding to the user's cursor with a subtle avoidance behavior — giving a sense of “living motion” without ever colliding or sticking.


## 🧠 Creator

Developed individually by *Saajidh*, as part of a web design competition project (Splendour '25) highlighting creativity, interactivity, and conceptual depth.
